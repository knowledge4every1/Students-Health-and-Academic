# Students Health and Academic Performance Dataset

This repository provides an extended and simulated dataset designed for analyzing and optimizing the relationship between students' physical health attributes and academic performance using machine learning and hybrid optimization techniques.

## üìÇ Dataset Overview

The dataset includes 260 simulated entries of college-level students, built to mimic real-world attributes from public datasets such as:
- [Students Health and Academic Performance (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/innocentmfa/students-health-and-academic-performance)
